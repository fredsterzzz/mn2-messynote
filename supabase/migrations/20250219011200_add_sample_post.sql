  '<h2>Introduction to AI Writing</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the way we create content. Here are some tips to make the most of AI writing tools while maintaining your unique voice.</p>

<h3>1. Start with Clear Objectives</h3>
<p>Before using any AI tool, define your:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target audience</li>
  <li>Content goals</li>
  <li>Key message</li>
  <li>Desired tone</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Use AI as a Collaborator</h3>
<p>Think of AI as your writing partner, not a replacement. It can help with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generating ideas</li>
  <li>Outlining content</li>
  <li>Suggesting improvements</li>
  <li>Checking grammar and style</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Maintain Your Voice</h3>
<p>Always review and edit AI-generated content to ensure it matches your style and brand voice. Add personal experiences, insights, and examples to make the content uniquely yours.</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Here are some code examples showing how to structure your prompts:</p>

<pre><code>// Good prompt structure
{
  "tone": "professional but friendly",
  "audience": "tech-savvy content creators",
  "format": "how-to guide",
  "key_points": [
    "AI writing basics",
    "Prompt engineering",
    "Content refinement"
  ]
}</code></pre>
